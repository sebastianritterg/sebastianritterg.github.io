## About me

I am a PhD student in Economics at the University of Barcelona, supervised by Vicente Royuela. My research focuses on the economics of migration—linguistic barriers, digital/green transitions and environmental migration. I am interested in regional economics & spatial analysis with causal-inference methods.
